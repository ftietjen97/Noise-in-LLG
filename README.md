# Noise-in-LLG
Comparing magnetization dynamics of the inertial LLG equation with either additive or multiplicative noise.

Do for both individually (additive and multiplicative noise)
1) Reduce the order of the inertial LLG equation to a first order differential equation.

Do for both cases in parallel
2) Solve the system of stochastic differential equations.

3) Compare the resulting picosecond behaviour.
4) Compare the resulting nanosecond behaviour.
5) Check temperature dependence.
